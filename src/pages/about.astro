  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    I am an analytics consultant focused on AI-related work, contact centre
    performance, and reporting systems that leaders can trust in production.
  </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Short bio</h2>
    <p>
      I support teams that need fast stabilization of reporting quality, then a
      practical path to sustainable analytics operations. My delivery approach
      is governance-first, evidence-led, and designed for real operating
      constraints.
    </p>

    <h2>How I work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with decision context, not dashboard-first output.</li>
      <li>Make assumptions explicit and test them early.</li>
      <li>Prioritize durable handover over one-off heroics.</li>
      <li>Keep leadership updates concise, measurable, and low-noise.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Tooling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>SQL, Power BI, and workflow automation tooling.</li>
      <li>Astro + MDX for publishable reporting and knowledge assets.</li>
      <li>Structured QA checkpoints for metric reliability.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>What I don't do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>High-volume content production without decision purpose.</li>
      <li>Unvalidated metric rollouts to executive audiences.</li>
      <li>Long engagements without clear outcomes and governance ownership.</li>
    </ul>
